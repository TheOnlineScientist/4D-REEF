										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Blog by 4D-Reef ESRs Mariya Perepelytsya, based at Deltares (the Netherlands), and Kathrine Maxwell, based at Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Research (Germany).</em></p>
<p>All PhD&#8217;s gathered for a network and training activity (NTA) in the field in Indonesia, for two weeks. After the first week in Makassar (read all about it in our <a href="/nta5/">previous blog here</a>), we packed our bags and left our hotel to catch our flights to Denpasar in Bali where we stayed for another week of networking, workshops, and team-building activities (the Bali way).</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Week 2 in Bali</strong></span></h3>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day 8</strong></span></h3>
<p><em>Mariya</em></p>
<p>The majority of us were flying to Denpasar at lunchtime. We were less lucky than Katt and Estra (who flew on another flight) and Bali welcomed us with a shower. However, even in the bad weather I was glued to the window of our bus on the way to the hotel! For someone who visited Bali for the first time, I was mesmerized by the rich architecture, temples, statues and blossoming flowers, not only on the trees around but in front of every place as daily offerings. We rounded the evening with a tasty group dinner and relaxed before the workday ahead of us.</p>

<p><em>Katt</em></p>
<p>Day 8: 0600H</p>
<p>Left the hotel very early to catch the morning flight to Denpasar. We were gifted with a very nice view of the Spermonde Archipelago. Bali welcomed us with fair weather. We had a short sweet break because of our travel from Makassar so we decided to walk along Sanur beach after grabbing lunch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-4004" src="/wp-content/uploads/Photo9B.jpg" alt="" width="583" height="437" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/Photo9B-200x150.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/Photo9B-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/Photo9B-400x300.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/Photo9B-600x450.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/Photo9B.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" /></p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day 9</strong></span></h3>
<p><em>Mariya</em></p>
<p>We were welcomed at the Coral Triangle Center, which is a non-profit foundation focusing on coral reef protection, education, supporting marine management and many other aspects in the field of marine conservation and sustainability. You can learn more here:  <a href="https://www.coraltrianglecenter.org/about-us/">https://www.coraltrianglecenter.org/about-us/</a>.</p>
<p>During the morning we got a chance to learn about the work done by the Center and experience first-hand various outreach activities aimed to inspire a wider audience in marine protection. These activities included team-played escape rooms, art exhibition “Harmony Island” by Mulyana, getting acquainted with the coral restoration projects across the Coral Triangle and the marine biodiversity database. What is more, you can take diving lessons and learn about the environmental best practices for diving and snorkeling. Impressively broad range of activities available at CTC for everyone!</p>
<p>During the afternoon, we engaged in discussions on collaboration initiatives between all the 4D-REEF ESR’s.</p>

<p><em>Katt</em></p>
<p>0800H</p>
<p>We walked our way to the Coral Triangle Center (CTC) which is just several meters from the hotel. We learned about the CTC ‘s activities as an NGO focussed on marine protection and had team-building activities: the CTC escape rooms and marine-themed card game. We also had the afternoon full of discussions on collaborations between our projects.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day 10</strong></span></h3>
<p><em>Mariya</em></p>
<p>It was a team-building day and nothing is better for that than having a trip together! Any words to describe it would be quite bleak in comparison to the natural beauty and cultural richness of the Ubud area. The only note for myself: if you can bike in the Netherlands with the phone in your hands (which is forbidden anyway), that doesn’t mean you should attempt filming everything around on the steep curvy roads, cause you may kiss the asphalt :D</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-4002" src="/wp-content/uploads/Day-3.png" alt="" width="715" height="715" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/Day-3-66x66.png 66w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-3-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-3-200x200.png 200w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-3-300x300.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-3-400x400.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-3-600x600.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-3-768x768.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-3-800x800.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-3-1024x1024.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-3-1200x1200.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-3-1536x1536.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-3.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" /></p>
<p><em>Katt</em></p>
<p>0830H</p>
<p>We head down to Ubud district to continue with our team-building activities and cultural experience in Bali. I was really hesitant to go on biking around Ubud area at first, but after the experience, I was one of the people who enjoyed it the most. We cycled in different areas in Ubud seeing the traditional Bali houses, temples, and really good sceneries of rice fields. We went to Pura Puseh Desa Batuan, a Hindu temple, and to the Tegenungan Waterfall, a tourist spot.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day 11</strong></span></h3>
<p><em>Mariya</em></p>
<p>Ibu Rili Djohani &#8211; Executive Director and Founder of the Coral Triangle Center, welcomed us at the CTC and shared her professional development story and her work on “ Turning knowledge and science into the ground action”. From actions on local level via online CTC Academy and development of interactive learning activities (which we enjoyed as well on Day 9), inviting tourists and locals to think and care more about the oceans, to development of Indonesian National strategies for marine protected areas (MPAs) by 2030 and work on Ocean20 &#8211; Rili Djohani is a role model for young marine scientists and I was honoured to meet her.</p>
<p>Other speakers of the day were Ranny Yuneni, who told us about the population decline of endangered marine species and translation of the biodiversity protection efforts into policies; and representatives of organisations Pesisir Lestari and Blue ventures introduced us to their work on providing support for community-based octopus fisheries and management in Indonesia.</p>
<p>The day was concluded with a workshop by Dr. Arjun Chennu (Max-Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, and a supervisor in 4D-Reef) on data sharing &#8211; his experiences and role of open access data in facilitating knowledge exchange and collaborations.</p>
<p><em>Katt</em></p>
<p><em>0830h</em></p>
<p>We head back to the CTC to have another day of talks and discussions; this time about NGOs and how to make impact at various levels with science, from local to global policies.</p>
<p>We were welcomed by CTC Executive Director Rili Djohani and she kicked off the morning session with her talk on policy development and the role of NGOs in translating science into policy. Personally, I am really inspired by her work and advocacy on marine conservation and management. After the morning session about the work of NGOs in Indonesia, Dr. Arjun Chennu gave a workshop on data sharing—sharing his experiences and lessons learned about sharing data.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day 12</strong></span></h3>
<p><em>Mariya</em></p>
<p>Early morning start to get to the Nusa Penida Marine Protected Area (MPA), to learn more in the field on coral reefs and mangroves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the waves were too high to snorkel in the open waters with hope to see mantas in the Manta Bay, so we proceeded to Nusa Lembongan. There we visited the Mangrove forest with the boat tour around it and learned about the conservation initiatives to protect mangroves and their biodiversity in the area. After lunch, we snorkelled over the local reefs, explore the differences and similarities with the reefs near Makassar. And where we were lucky enough to see some dolphins and some of us a turtle. The abundance of colors was truly mesmerizing! The last stop of the day was the CTC community center on the island where we tagged reef stars (see previous blog, on the MARS project with reef stars) and placed them within the MPA. In the evening we concluded the 2 week NTA Indonesia with a team dinner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-4003" src="/wp-content/uploads/Day-5.png" alt="" width="770" height="770" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/Day-5-66x66.png 66w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-5-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-5-200x200.png 200w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-5-300x300.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-5-400x400.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-5-600x600.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-5-768x768.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-5-800x800.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-5-1024x1024.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-5-1200x1200.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-5-1536x1536.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/Day-5.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></p>
<p><em>Katt</em></p>
<p><em>0723H</em></p>
<p>Day 5 in Bali. We took the boat and visited islands Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan. Here we visited a mangrove forest, learned more about coral reefs and coral restoration in the field, and participated in a coral tagging activity with Reef Stars (see also <a href="/nta5/">our first blog</a> for more information about Reef Stars).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, Bali. Thank you, Makassar. Thank you, Indonesia for welcoming us. We will definitely be back again. We were greeted by this rainbow during our second day in Bali.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Blog by 4D-Reef ESRs Mariya Perepelytsya, based at Deltares (the Netherlands), and Kathrine Maxwell, based at Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Research (Germany).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last 17 to 29 October 2022, the 4D-REEF Team went to Indonesia for the fifth Networking and Training Activity (NTA) after almost 2.5 years of waiting. It was two weeks of, well, networking and training activities, with the ESRs and our Indonesian colleagues. We spent our first week in Makassar in South Sulawesi and our second week in Denpasar in Bali, visiting the island communities, snorkeling on the reefs, learning from local experts, and seeing the marine conservation efforts in the region along with enjoying the Indonesian culture and, most especially, good food. It was generally a memorable experience for the ESRs as we have gotten closer and learned useful information, especially now that the program comes to its fruition. As we were also joined by our Indonesian colleagues, some of us even got closer to our Indonesian friends (and some had the chance to meet new ones). We thought of sharing with you a glimpse of some of the memorable experiences we had during the NTA – the activities, the reefs, and the tasty food and good company.</p>

<p>After 38 hours on the go I was finally rewarded with a luxury of a hot shower and a comfortable bed. Not a lot of sleep, as in the morning I had to rush for a tasty breakfast and enjoying the view of the sea from my window. After meeting most of the 4D-REEF team and having coffee for some functioning, I joined a part of the team in discovering our surroundings. We visited the Fort of Rotterdam, all that effort and long way, and yet I am back to Rotterdam again!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the evening most of us arrived in Makassar, so it was time for a group dinner, live music and trying the first Indonesian cuisine dishes.</p>

<p>Start of the NTA program in Swiss-Belhotel in Makassar where we had a whole day of talks about coastal livelihood and fisheries in Indonesia. I was introduced to the fishing culture and social organization in Indonesia. The talks made me think how complex the fishing industry in Indonesia is and how it is tied to social relationships between various agents and institutions.</p>

<p>We were welcomed by Prof. Jamaluddin Jompa at UNHAS, and our programme followed with a set of seminars on marine management and conservation. I was shocked and inspired at the same time by the talk of Tries Razak, PhD, on reef restoration practices. Inspired by successful ones and shocked by the destructive impacts of poorly-designed ones.

<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wednesday &#8211; Day 3</span><br />
</strong></h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mariya </strong></span></p>
<p>Dream day &#8211; field day!</p>
<p>We started with Barrang Lompo and visited the UNHAS field station and had a walk around the island to learn about the livelihood of the island. Colourful houses, many built with sturdy massive corals, kids, riding the “daycare” bike-cart with music and fishermen, drying their catch in the hot midday sun. Some of them dried trepang &#8211;  sea cucumbers &#8211; the marine animal of great value, captured from the sea bottom (a dangerous process of capture for fishermen) and sold to China. The people of Makassar traded sea cucumbers with Indigineous Australians and China since the 18th century en-masse. Sadly, because of the expensive price of sea-cucumbers, none of the local fishermen we met have ever tried even a tiny piece of the animal &#8211; all of the capture is sold overseas.</p>
<p>On the next islands we visited &#8211;  Pulau Bonetambung and Pulao Kudingareng Lompo, we learned about the local community initiative to set up an aquaculture facility and a primary school for kids to get the basic education. Life on those further islands from Makassar city is also complicated by the shortages of fresh water, and we witnessed how locals are dealing with this issue in their households.</p>
<p>And I also learned a lot from the local people &#8211; big smiles, music and happiness &#8211; despite all of the hardships they have daily, they are genuinely happy, with everything the day brings to them &#8211; something we need to remind ourselves more often about!</p>

<p>Day 3: 0700H</p>
<p>Field day! Yay! We visited select islands of the Spermonde archipelago—Barrang Lompo, Pulau Bonetambung, and Pulau Kudingarenglompo—to have a look at the coastal communities and their livelihoods on the islands. What strikes me the most is that the ones we visited are really low-lying islands and are densely populated. Also they use corals as foundations of their houses and coastal walls. We had dinner at Konro Karebosi with almost everyone. One of the best restaurants one must visit when coming to Makassar!</p>

<p>Guided by Lily Damayanti and Cudo Prasetya, we witnessed HOPE of MARS coral restoration project efforts. 14m-long letters are built from hundreds of  reef stars &#8211; 3D stable steel structures coated in resin and sand for creating a surface for coral attachment. Overall,coral fragments from 42 species and collected sustainably (e.g. from breakage after storms) from nearby reefs with similar environmental conditions to facilitate coral survivability and are attached to reef stars.</p>
<p>Also, I snorkelled for the first time ever! An exciting day, with bumps of leaking snorkel tubes :D But enjoying the day with our amazing boat crew and being rewarded by them with tasty donuts &#8211; all the efforts were worth it!</p>

<p>Back to UNHAS for one day of roundtable discussions on international research collaborations. We spent most of our time in the afternoon networking among ourselves and being updated with each and everyone’s research progress. We also spent some time working on project synthesis and collaborative work among the ESRs. We had a nice impromptu visit to the UNHAS coral museum where we saw their coral collections. Dinner (Coto Makassar) then some karaoke after.</p>

<p>Visiting reef sites again!</p>
<p>Cats, cats, cats everywhere on Kodingareng Keke. And great view onto the reef structure from the observation point &#8211; you can even see the seasonal sediment dynamics patterns, change in coral cover between reef flat and slope. Also, the island has pretty interesting history of unsuccessful commercialising of the area and failed efforts of the hotel construction. All in all &#8211; no wonder it did not work &#8211; the island is very dynamic, small and has no fresh water!</p>
<p>Samalona island – one of the closest to the shore, turbid reef. To our surprise, the coral cover was amazing, considering a lot of it was absent some 10 years ago! In some areas of the reef, coral cover was up to 95%, so we had to be careful swimming around.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mariya</strong></span></p>
<p>As for my day off &#8211; no rest for the wicked! Starting at 7am, I joined our little crew to collect some sediment samples for future composition analysis of grains with the AI, developed by our colleague, William Harrison. We returned to Kodingareng Keke for the transect sampling across the reef flat. In the areas closer to the rim it got really tricky, as there was so much coral cover that I barely could get some sand!</p>
<p>Things were more complicated in the degraded turbid reef site &#8211; strong current, no coral is sight and fields of sea urchins. I got deserved rest and a great recovery after swimming for so long with a relaxing massage by Indonesian masters and enjoying another tasty dinner and fruit drinks. Everyone has to try sirsak! And if you are weak to spicy food &#8211; it will save you &#x1f642; To continue with the first experiences &#8211; I joined guys for the evening karaoke &#8211; something I have never done before but now will definitely do again!</p>

<p>Day 7: 0600H</p>
<p>It was our rest day, but I decided to visit an older carbonate reef in South Sulawesi. Whole day of travel, yet I enjoyed it since I was joined by very helpful and dependable Indonesian marine researchers.</p>
<div class="fusion-clearfix"></div></div></div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-fusion-800 wp-image-3929" src="/wp-content/uploads/Photo-8B-800x600.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/Photo-8B-200x150.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/Photo-8B-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/Photo-8B-400x300.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/Photo-8B-600x450.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/Photo-8B-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/Photo-8B-800x600.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/Photo-8B-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/Photo-8B-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/Photo-8B-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/Photo-8B-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Nice view of the beach and terraces to cap off the week in South Sulawesi.</em></p>
<p>Whole-day seminars, informative presentations, chats in-between coffee breaks and lunches, long-hours of discussions, site visits on reef islands, snorkeling on different reefs, fun chats while walking, and several boat rides. Endless coconuts, hotel rooftop drinks, occasional massages, souvenir shopping, lovely food, getting soaked by rain, soaking in the pool, karaoke, and long catching-up chats.</p>
<p>From participating in various program-related activities to enjoying non-program-related activities, the ESRs, our Indonesian colleagues, and supervisors had a very productive NTA in Makassar.</p>
<p>The first week of the NTA was very insightful as we were updated about the latest state of marine research, management, and conservation efforts in Indonesia. We found it inspiring to see the MARS success story and the different marine research work in Indonesia. The marine pollution problem (which is caused by a multitude of factors like government in/action, local behavior, heavy plastic use, and many others) in the region is quite noticeable along the coastal areas and offshore islands. As part of the ESRs who were not able to join the fieldwork in Spermonde, it was nice for us to visit the reefs studied by 4D-REEF.</p>
<p>Next up, we’ll share some of our experiences when we flew to Bali Island for the second part of our NTA. Stay tuned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we unfortunately had to postpone our planned fieldwork in Indonesia and therefore also the Network Training Activity that was scheduled to take place in Makassar. This NTA would have included training in field techniques and explorations of the turbid reef environments in the Spermonde Archipelago in south Sulawesi, Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, we filled this NTA program with other activities including a training on science communication, topical discussion groups, and a panel session around Indonesian perspectives to coral reef management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3334" src="/wp-content/uploads/NTA2_SciComm.png" alt="" width="596" height="727" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/NTA2_SciComm-200x244.png 200w, /wp-content/uploads/NTA2_SciComm-246x300.png 246w, /wp-content/uploads/NTA2_SciComm-400x488.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/NTA2_SciComm.png 596w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure 1. Thirza Stam, Science Communicator at Naturalis Biodiversity Center, provided an engaging training on how to use social media and write concise short stories about your research. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ESR2, Elsa B. Girard, wrote the following summary about NTA2:</span></p>
<p><b>To keep the conversation going…</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First reactions of the 4D-REEF consortium when we heard that NTA2 would be online for a second time: “Really!?”, “Can’t we postpone it instead?”, “Not again&#8230;”. Such reactions are understandable, as it means hours of virtual interactions, and especially because the consortium has not yet had the chance to meet in person since the ESRs have been appointed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once NTA2 was settled, a positive wave hit the consortium and we definitely looked forward to “getting together” again. During three half-days, we discussed the advancement of each ESR’s project and the preparation for future fieldwork. We also had the pleasure to hear about the Indonesian socio-economic perspectives surrounding coral reef management by a distinguished panel with Indonesian managers and scientists:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3332" src="/wp-content/uploads/NTA2_panel.png" alt="" width="679" height="336" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/NTA2_panel-200x99.png 200w, /wp-content/uploads/NTA2_panel-300x148.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/NTA2_panel-400x198.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/NTA2_panel-600x297.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/NTA2_panel.png 679w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This NTA was a success at all levels! Not only collaborations between ESRs and between different institutions are flourishing, but we also feel more and more connected to one another. </span></p>

<p>Over the next two days, everyone gave presentations on their research topics. Chantal and Elsa make Google documents and spreadsheets listing what sorts of data each project expects to generate and what data from other projects would benefit it. This is helping us form collaborations and plan field work.</p>
<p>On the final day we discussed plans for fieldwork in the morning and heard an informative introduction to carbonate producers by Gary Murphy. The day wrapped up with a virtual happy hour at 1:30PM-10:30PM depending on which time zone the participant was in. By then we believed ourselves masters of Zoom and attempted to break the lonely isolation by gathering in Max’s study with mixed results. (Fig. 1; Fig 2).</p>
