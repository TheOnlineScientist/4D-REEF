<p><strong>Digitizing the Spermonde coral reefs: a paradise of corals, turf and algae</strong></p>
<p>Finally! During August of last year (2022), we went to our promised field sites in the beautiful sandy islands of the Spermonde Archipelago, just in front of the bustling city of Makassar &#8211; South Sulawesi &#8211; Indonesia. This archipelago is located in the heart of the marine biodiversity hotspot known as the Coral Triangle, a dream destination for marine researchers. Almost three years we waited to go, and just after the pandemic regulations and global crises relaxed a tiny bit, we packed our (many) bags and went to the field. Each one of us early stage researchers (ESRs) had planned their sampling strategies and locations carefully, considering our research goals, but also accounting for possible collaborations within the team and/or with our amazing partners from the local Hasanuddin University (UNHAS) in Makassar. This specific story is about the collaboration of three 4D-REEF ESRs: Estra, Dino and Daniel, with three outstanding Indonesian students from UNHAS: Phita, Gunawan and Agung, who all flew from the warm Indonesian weather to the frosty German winter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Something in common: reef benthos</strong></p>
<p>To collaborate within our small team we had to identify what binds our three research projects together. And luckily, the link was easy to find, since in all our cases we are interested in the coral reef benthos (a.k.a., the habitat on the seafloor).</p>
<p>In Estra’s project, for example, she is looking at the ecological implications of shifts from hard corals to turf algae (assemblages of many diminutive species of algae) in turbid reefs. Turf algae and corals live in balance unless the ecosystem is disturbed (usually by man-made pressures), in which case the loss of coral could mean an overexpansion of turf algae. Estra, along with four students from UNHAS, studies the reef&#8217;s turf algae mats and how they change over time, as well as their role in the ecosystem (i.e., trapping sediments and detritus &#8211; Gunawan; providing nutritious food for herbivorous fish &#8211; Munawarrah; competing of space with hard corals and other biotas &#8211; Agung) and their interactions with other organisms, such as corals and fish (Puspita).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-fusion-800 wp-image-3960" src="/wp-content/uploads/02_turf-algae-800x680.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="680" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/02_turf-algae-200x170.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/02_turf-algae-300x255.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/02_turf-algae-400x340.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/02_turf-algae-600x510.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/02_turf-algae-768x653.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/02_turf-algae-800x680.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/02_turf-algae-1024x870.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/02_turf-algae-1200x1020.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/02_turf-algae-1536x1305.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/02_turf-algae-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><i>Turf algae mats covered dead corals on Samalona Island. In reefs near Makassar City (e.g., Lae Lae, Samalona), where sedimentation and river run-off were significant, turf algae mats can cover more than 50% of the bottom substrate and trap a large amount of sediment and detritus. Offshore reefs exhibit fewer turf algae assemblages and sediments/detritus trapped within turf algae (e.g., Kapoposang, Karang Kassi).</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dino’s research focuses on the crustose coralline algae (CCA), a type of red algae with calcified thalli (term referring to algal bodies). They are a key player in the ecosystem, as they are considered to literally build the reef framework together with stony corals (juvenile corals also seem to prefer them when selecting a place to settle). Dino is looking into the diversity of these often overlooked organisms and how their communities shift with varying conditions in the reef, particularly turbidity, in the Spermonde Archipelago.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-fusion-800 wp-image-3961" src="/wp-content/uploads/04_CCA-800x300.png" alt="" width="800" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/04_CCA-200x75.png 200w, /wp-content/uploads/04_CCA-300x113.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/04_CCA-400x150.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/04_CCA-600x225.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/04_CCA-768x288.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/04_CCA-800x300.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/04_CCA-1024x384.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/04_CCA-1200x450.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/04_CCA-1536x576.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/04_CCA.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><i>While not immediately noticeable in most coral reefs, you only need to look in the spaces among the corals to find the ubiquitous CCA. Like the more colorful corals, they can take various morphologies such as the branching form seen in the right image in between the Acropora. Currently twenty species of CCA have been described in the Spermonde Archipelago based on morpho-anatomical characters. This is likely an underestimation based on the abundance of cryptic species detected in recent studies of CCA using DNA. With a lack of basic taxonomic knowledge, even less is known about each of these species’ ecological functions!</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daniel’s project targets the creation of maps of the coral reefs, describing the whole benthic ecosystem by applying advanced underwater imaging techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines. Understanding the spatial distribution of organisms on the maps can help to identify their specific life strategies and adaptability in the case of future changes to their environments.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3962" src="/wp-content/uploads/05_habitat_maps-1024x764.png" alt="" width="1024" height="764" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/05_habitat_maps-200x149.png 200w, /wp-content/uploads/05_habitat_maps-300x224.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/05_habitat_maps-400x299.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/05_habitat_maps-600x448.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/05_habitat_maps-768x573.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/05_habitat_maps-800x597.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/05_habitat_maps-1024x764.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/05_habitat_maps-1200x896.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/05_habitat_maps.png 1341w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><i>Examples of habitat maps created from data acquired using the HyperDiver camera system in Curacaoan coral reefs in the Caribbean. Habitat maps such as these help scientists elucidate the spatial distributions of organisms and substrate types in their ecosystems. If created over a temporal period they also help understand interactions between the organisms and their environment. Overall, maps are a great monitoring tool that can influence important conservation and ecological management decisions.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of our projects require the base knowledge that comes from answering 2 questions: what class of organisms and substrates can be found in the reefs of Spermonde? And how much/many of each class can be found in the reefs?</p>
<p>To answer these questions we organized secondments, where we could exchange our expertise to make the best out of the data we collected in the field work. Thus, we organized a big 6 week workshop, and with help of the Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research (ZMT), the Max-Planck-Institute for Marine Microbiology (MPIMM), the University of Granada (UGR), and the 4D-REEF central organization board in Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden we invited the three Indonesian students to Bremen, Germany. The workshop took place from the 9th of January until the 17th of February 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So many pictures, so little time!</strong></p>
<p>The data and tools each of us collected on our field trip were very similar, only with differing strategies. We all collected top-down images of the seafloor and wanted to annotate (label) all the organisms we found in them. This is not as trivial as it may sound though. Between Estra and Dino and their team, they collected almost 5000 pictures! Daniel also collected over 60000 images (it’s not a competition, but who’s counting?). No life of ours could be spent annotating all 65000 images. At this point we decided that some automation, inspired by the current AI boom, was needed. But even the smartest of computers needs some manual help from us primitive humans, to learn what exactly to detect in the images.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Automatic point annotations</strong></p>
<p>For the first set of images (~5000) we wanted to annotate a random selection of 50 points (pixels) with a meaningful label. Estra and her students carefully detailed a set of 73 labels (a labelset) describing all organisms and substrates to be found on the coral reef floor. Later we reduced the labelset to 37 labels, for better performance when automating the process. Then, armed with this labelset, the “Coral Point Count with excel extension (CPCe)” software and full commitment, they annotated 821 images.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Although image annotation is done individually, this workshop fostered team discussions and knowledge sharing, leading to a better image annotation process and benthic identification.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set of human-annotated images was then the input to a machine learning (ML) web service called <a href="https://coralnet.ucsd.edu/">CoralNet (</a><a href="https://coralnet.ucsd.edu/">link)</a>. In this great software offered publicly by the University of California in San Diego (UCSD), a set of pre-annotated images is uploaded, used for training a complex neural network, which in turn is used to predict the annotations on new uploaded images, which do not contain any previous annotations. As part of the ESRs’ secondments we all gathered in Bremen Germany, and went over a 3 week workshop, to learn how to set up the CoralNet project and to establish the benefits of such technologies.</p>

<p><i>The manual Coral Point Count annotations done by Estra and her students amounted to 41050 points over 37 benthic classes in 821 images! These points were used to train the CoralNet machine learning algorithm.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After training the networks, we tried the first predictions on new images. Because of the complexity of such an ecosystem, the different lighting conditions and possible human error in the annotations, the accuracy of the network was good but not great (57% accuracy). Nonetheless, the CoralNet platform allows to then manually confirm the annotations, by suggesting possible candidates for each new point in each new image. This can reduce the time of annotating significantly (still to be quantified). For comparison, it took three students almost three months to annotate 821 images, whereas CoralNet finished over 4000 images in a couple of hours. There are other parameters that can as well be tweaked to make the predictions more confident. Overall the outcome of the process was positive and we will continue to use its outputs for our study results.</p>

<p><i>Image with CPCe annotations (left) and a view of CoralNet annotation suggestions with a confidence percentage provided by the AI (right).</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Manual polygon annotations</strong></p>
<p>The other big batch of images (~60k) was captured using the HyperDiver (<a href="/coral-reef-habitat-mapping-in-corona-times/">see Daniel&#8217;s blog (link)</a> ) by a team of great divers (Dino, Agung, Agus, Dedi, Supardi, Asriadi and Masdar) and one lone snorkeler (Daniel). In contrast to our previous set of images, these were stitched together to create a larger view of the seafloor (an orthomosaic), by a process called photogrammetry. The advantage of these larger scenes is that it is easy to georeference the data, and to create a better spatial description of the seafloor habitat and organism communities. In total we collected 13 of these large plots across 5 islands.</p>
<p>To manually annotate every organism in these large images would be a cumbersome effort. Thus, we decided to annotate a smaller subset of every organism/substrate type that we found, in order to train machine learning networks to automatically annotate the rest of the area for us. We planned the manual annotation part of the process to take place during the last three weeks of the secondment project.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-fusion-800 wp-image-3966" src="/wp-content/uploads/09_taglab-800x307.png" alt="" width="800" height="307" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/09_taglab-200x77.png 200w, /wp-content/uploads/09_taglab-300x115.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/09_taglab-400x154.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/09_taglab-600x230.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/09_taglab-768x295.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/09_taglab-800x307.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/09_taglab-1024x393.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/09_taglab-1200x461.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/09_taglab-1536x590.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/09_taglab.png 3032w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><i>TagLab annotation tool with coral-colony-annotations highlighted. We aimed at annotating as far down the taxonomic tree as possible. In the case of coral, we were able to use genus-level labels, given the high resolution of the orthomosaics and the high level of expertise from our annotators.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using <a href="http://taglab.isti.cnr.it/">TagLab (link)</a>, a great tool developed by the Visual Computing Laboratory in Italy, we again started annotating many organisms and substrate types in the images, with the only difference being that now we annotated polygons instead of single points. This process is usually tedious and time consuming when using a non-specialized tool, such as a GIS platform, but with the tools that TagLab offers, the process was significantly improved. After a quick introduction to the tools by Daniel, and in only three weeks, the amazing students Phita, Gunawan and Agung, drew and annotated almost 1600 polygons across 3 of the large plots! The labelset used in these annotations has great detail, and covers 36 coral genera, many soft coral genera, sponges, anemones, cyanobacterial mats, turf algae, amongst many other organisms and substrate types. In a further research study these annotations will be used to train an advanced machine learning algorithm to detect individual organisms as well as their surrounding environments with great accuracy. The fully annotated maps created by the AI will then be used to elucidate spatial characteristics of the coral reefs and hopefully set a baseline for future studies.</p>

<p><i>The result of the orthomosaic annotation was great for only 3 weeks of intense annotations. We created 1596 polygons down to genus level for corals, soft corals and macroalgae, as well as other biota and substrate types.</i></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></p>
<p>We had a great time during the secondment and annotation workshop, which was the conclusion to getting to know each other during the field trip and planning and executing a collaboration with a transdisciplinary and multi-cultural team. We produced knowledge that will help each of us through our career paths and learned to collaborate and communicate with local partners, a much needed skill if we want to make science accessible and visible to researchers worldwide.</p>

<p><i>Having a delicious Peruvian meal (at the “Pachamama” restaurant in Bremen) with the team and Katherine Maxwell, another 4D-Reef member based in Bremen, was a great way to end the secondment.</i></p>
<p>Finally, we, the ESRs and UNHAS students, would like to thank everybody who made this small collaborative effort possible, starting by our institutes, the Naturalis team, our fellow ESRs, our supervisors, but specially to the amazing team in Indonesia, who welcomed us from the beginning and created such a nice atmosphere to work in, besides giving valuable input/guidance/sweat-and-hard-work for our projects; Terima kasih!</p>

<p><em>By Estradivari, PhD student of 4D-REEF at Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research (ZMT). </em></p>
<p><strong>Conserving the turbid reefs, why do we care?</strong></p>
<p>Nowadays, issues of turbidity and sedimentation on coral reefs have received increasing attention from scholars<sup>1–6</sup>. This is perhaps because turbid reefs comprise 30% of reefs in the Coral Triangle (i.e., a marine ecoregion that consists of six countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Timor Leste, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands) and 12% globally<sup>6</sup>; however, our understanding of these murky environments is still limited. Challenges in conducting research in low visibility, high sedimentation, and silty environments, or constrained funding can be a few of the reasons that hinder studies in turbid reefs.</p>
<p>Turbid reefs are light-limited coral habitats and typically are situated at shallow depths (&lt;10 m) and nearshore (&lt;20 km from the coast)<sup>1</sup>. Turbid reefs feature water column turbidity with a high concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM) consisting of inorganic materials that derive from terrestrial sources through river run-off or wind-driven mixing, and organic materials such as phytoplankton, zooplankton, and bacteria. These particles absorb and scatter the amount of light in the water column, creating a low-light environment. Depending on the sources of turbidity, turbid reefs can be broadly categorized into natural turbid reefs (i.e., source of turbidity from river run-off, flooding, etc.), anthropogenic turbid reefs (i.e., sources of turbidity from deforestation, dredging, coastal development, etc.), or mixed natural-anthropogenic turbid reefs<sup>1</sup>. The state of a turbid reef can be dynamic over a long period; for example, a natural turbid reef can change into an anthropogenic turbid reef when there is an unstainable land-use change or vice versa, and it depends on how we use and manage our coastal environments.</p>
<p>Understanding the turbid reefs in the Coral Triangle is critically important. This region hosts a wealth of marine taxa and is the epicenter of the world&#8217;s marine biodiversity<sup>7,8</sup>. This region has been experiencing the most rapid coastal population growth globally<sup>9</sup> and has large population densities in coastal zones<sup>10</sup>. With the high dependency of coastal communities on marine resources<sup>11</sup> and the rapid growth of coastal cities<sup>12</sup>, almost 90% of coral reefs in the Coral Triangle are at risk from overexploitation and degradation<sup>11</sup>. With these threats, the already high percentage of turbid reefs in the Coral Triangle (30%) is likely to increase in the future, with anthropogenic turbid reefs will become more dominant.</p>
<p>From several available studies, evidence shows that turbid reefs are characterized by reduced growth, coral bleaching, and mortality<sup>13</sup>, relatively low coral cover and high algae cover<sup>14</sup>, and typically dominated by stress-tolerant coral taxa<sup>15</sup>. Turbid reefs near cities or urban areas have a higher risk from future global stressors (e.g., global warming) than turbid reefs in remote areas<sup>1</sup> because they are more exposed to additional diverse and numerous local threats. Although turbid reefs may have lower ecological functions than other reef systems, such reefs still provide value in terms of biodiversity and for the communities living in the surrounding areas<sup>11,16,17</sup>. With our current limited knowledge on turbid reefs, this clearly highlights a need for more (comprehensive) research into these issues in order to better understand the impacts of stressors and to improve turbid reef management.</p>
<p>To reduce further degradation or improve the condition of turbid reefs, an appropriate area-based management and conservation strategy is necessary. The common approach by implementing marine protected areas (MPAs) that are widely used across the globe can be used for conserving turbid reefs, subject to local conditions and if the local authorities and communities wish to do so. Nevertheless, for an MPA to achieve its intended biodiversity conservation goals, there are minimum requirements that should be fulfilled, including ecological requirements (e.g., having healthy coastal ecosystems, unique species, and/or low local threats)<sup>18</sup> and management capacity requirements (e.g., human resources, enforcement, funding, etc.)<sup>19</sup>. An alternative area-based management approach should be applied when the turbid reefs cannot meet such requirements.</p>
<p>In 2010, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) introduced a new conservation tool to complement MPAs, namely other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). Unlike MPAs that aim for long-term biodiversity conservation, OECMs can have diverse management objectives (e.g., customary management, fisheries, tourism, and many more), but they must contribute to <em>in situ</em> biodiversity conservation<sup>20</sup>. OECMs can have a diverse range of area-based practices and mechanisms, such as traditional fisheries tenure rights in the Philippines<sup>21</sup>, fish aggregation device installation in Malaysia<sup>22</sup>, community-based mangrove rehabilitation<sup>23</sup>, and private-led no-take areas<sup>24</sup> in Indonesia, provided that these areas have some form of management and are governed by an entity, and deliver biodiversity outcomes. This OECM concept aligns with the famous Nobel Prize winner Elinor Ostrom&#8217;s theory on <em>common pool resources</em><sup>25</sup> where common resources (e.g., fishes, seaweeds, corals) could be well-managed by individuals or communities who live nearby the resources. With the high flexibility of OECM management in terms of the mechanisms, governing body, rules, and enforcement, OECMs have considerable potential to be applied for conserving turbid reefs.</p>
<p>Although the CBD has equally promoted MPAs and OECMs for reaching global conservation targets (i.e., 10% of conserved marine areas in 2020<sup>26</sup> and 30% in 2030<sup>27</sup>), there are still limited ‘real-life examples’ of official OECM recognition, especially in the Coral Triangle. With the communities’ high dependency on marine resources and rich traditional marine management<sup>11,28</sup>, this region indeed has diverse area-based practices other than MPAs that can be recognized as OECMs. A recent study shows that Indonesia has a high diversity (~14 types) and number (&gt;390) of potential marine OECMs<sup>29</sup> (Figure 1), some of which are located in turbid environments.</p>

<p>With the rapid coastal development and intensive terrestrial activities in the Coral Triangle nations, which may add even more sedimentation and turbidity pressures to reef environments, we are racing with time to understand the ecological characteristics and processes of turbid reefs and to find suitable ways to manage and conserve them. My research (ESR5) within the 4D-REEF project tries to address these challenges by evaluating long-term turf algae and fish herbivore patterns, identifying the distribution and effectiveness of potential marine OECMs and their overlap with turbid reef environments, and documenting the ecological and social values of OECMs to conserve turbid reefs. Indonesia, my homeland, serves as my primary study site. My study on turbid reefs will provide an added value to the current limited knowledge of turbid reefs and provide valuable information to support the long-term marine conservation in Indonesia and the Coral Triangle region.</p>
