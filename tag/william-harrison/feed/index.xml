<p>From <del datetime="2022-03-21T08:58:34+00:00">April 20th to 24th, 2020 </del>February 20th through 26th 2022, the 4D-REEF consortium met once again. And this time we actually went to Spain! In person! Where better to launch an old-fashioned, in-person event than a hotel made out of sets of old movies? The grand Hotel El Dorado, in Carboneras, Spain provided a fantastic base of operations for our daily expeditions; starting around 8:30 we would pile onto the group bus and head wherever Juan Carlos led us. And as a professor from the University of Granada who has been working in the region so long that he wrote the information signs at some of our stops, Juan Carlos knew where to lead.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We did not need expert advice to see that the views were breathtaking, but Juan Carlos opened our eyes to the hills’ hidden histories. Under his guidance, a gently sloping hill became a talus slope, slight changes in the color of rocks became shallowing and re-flooding trends, and ancient coral reefs were suddenly everywhere!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly! Southern Spain used to have coral reefs. Now, I know how it is. When you hear a geologist say something ‘used to have’ something, you think “oh, this is one of those crazy geologist with no sense of time talking about when Spain ‘used to have’ dinosaurs”. But these reefs are barely 5 million years young! OK, maybe I am a crazy geologist with no sense of time, but 5 million years is nothing in geological time; why, the first hominids had already appeared by then! Back then, the Mediterranean waters around Spain were filled with corals and other reef taxa. Sadly, the entire Mediterranean dried up in the end of the Miocene; while it did re-flood in the Pliocene, all the reef corals had gone extinct and none of the waters connected to the Mediterranean had any corals to recolonize the Spanish coastline. The dead reefs were buried by later sediments and eventually dissolved since coral shells are made of unstable aragonite. Today they are preserved as casts of corals filled with more stable materials and caves where now-dissolved reefs used to reside.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3591" src="/wp-content/uploads/Figure-4.png" alt="" width="479" height="638" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/Figure-4-200x267.png 200w, /wp-content/uploads/Figure-4-225x300.png 225w, /wp-content/uploads/Figure-4-400x533.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/Figure-4.png 535w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most interesting taxa besides corals were, in my unbiased opinion as a foraminifera researcher, the foraminifera. These single-celled amoeba-like protists built lentil-sized shells to live in. Like corals, they enjoy living in warm water and thrive in well-lit conditions where they can farm photosynthetic algae. Unlike corals, they used stable calcite, so they are nicely preserved for us to find and study. Much prettier to look at!</p>

<p>All in all a great (and educational) time was had by all. But wait, there’s more to this trip than fieldwork! Wednesday we took a break from hiking to socialize and to plan. To plot. To scheme together and find opportunities for collaborations between ESRs. The day started with ESR project speed-dating, in which all 15 ESRs spent 5 minutes with each of the other ESRs discussing our projects and looking for places where they overlap. Then we moved to prearranged groups talking about pre-planned projects; ESRs who did not have a project to discuss planned to shoot a short film.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all a good time was had by everyone. Sadly, this journey had to come to a close. After eating together and exploring the reefs of Spain as a group, we had to part ways once more. Hopefully these discussions will bear many fruits and I look forward to seeing the completed film. Next time in Indonesia!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From April 20th to 24th, the 4D-REEF consortium met for the first time <del>in Carboneras, Spain</del> on Zoom. On the first day, everyone gave a 2 minute introduction to who we are through a single PowerPoint slide; how we structured the slide served to introduce how we think as well. For example, Max is really fond of precise timing!</p>
<p>Over the next two days, everyone gave presentations on their research topics. Chantal and Elsa make Google documents and spreadsheets listing what sorts of data each project expects to generate and what data from other projects would benefit it. This is helping us form collaborations and plan field work.</p>
<p>On the final day we discussed plans for fieldwork in the morning and heard an informative introduction to carbonate producers by Gary Murphy. The day wrapped up with a virtual happy hour at 1:30PM-10:30PM depending on which time zone the participant was in. By then we believed ourselves masters of Zoom and attempted to break the lonely isolation by gathering in Max’s study with mixed results. (Fig. 1; Fig 2).</p>
